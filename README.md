# LoRaWAN Viet Nam Parameters

## Introduction
Base on the recent release of LoRaWAN Alliance to update [RP2-1.0.1 LoRaWANÂ® Regional Parameters](https://lora-alliance.org/resource_hub/rp2-101-lorawan-regional-parameters/) and Viet Nam regulations about [LPWAN 920MHz-923MHz](https://mic.gov.vn/Upload_Moi/VanBan/38TT.PDF) we highly recommend the details of parameters for LoRaWAN connection.

## Join channels
There are 2 options for joining channels, depend on which device and gateway you have and the ability to adjust the join channels of them.
```
AS923   (923.2MHz and 923.4MHz) easy to adapt to the old device with some limitations on activation and custom frequencies plan.
AS923_2 (921.4MHz and 921.6MHz) make sure both gateway and device can adjust to work with these join channels.
```

## Activation
In OTAA activation the join channels are mandatory. On other hand, in ABP activation the join channels are optional.
```
AS923   Device should use ABP for better connectivity.
AS923_2 Device is possible to activate with OTAA and ABP.
```

## Frequencies Plan
This is the recommended frequencies plan for general devices, the devices can freely to choose 8ch between 920MHz-923MHz.
```
Uplink
